# Software Engineering Assignment 2
## Documentation:

### Certificate 1: 
The certificate titled: **C++ Design Patterns: Structural** gives insight into the structural design of Projects. The code written sometimes becomes unmanageable, so structural design plays a very important role. For example, class explosion can be avoided. **The Adapter** and **Facade** are some examples.

### Certificate 2:
The second certificate named **C++ Design Patterns: Behavioral** is very beneficial in controlling the behavior of code in projects. The behavior of how classes and their objects are created, interacted, and changed during program execution is very important. To make the code efficient and effective, we can use behavioral design patterns like **Command pattern** and **State pattern**.

### Certificate 3:
In the third certificate, which is **C++ Design Patterns: Creational**, I have learned that we can use different creational design patterns like **Factory Method** and **Singleton Method** to optimize the code for efficiency, accuracy, and generalization.
# C++ Implementation of Ant Farm Simulation
## Code documentation:
### File named **newAntFarm.cpp**:
File named **newAntFarm.cpp** is the actual code file in which the classes of all the operations, while focusing on design patterns, are mentioned. Here is the guide to `newAntFarm.cpp` with the screenshots of outputs.
In the code file, I have implemented different classes and organized the code for Meadows using various design patterns:
- Singleton Meadow class is created for Meadows.
- Factory method is used in AntFactory and its subclasses.
- Decorator pattern is used for the attributes of the ants.
- Builder pattern is used in AntFarm and its subclasses.

I have specified 12 ant species based on my Roll no which ((2%6)+10)=12.

The output screenshots are given below:
